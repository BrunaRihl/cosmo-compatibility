## Flowchart

In the planning stage, I drafted a basic structure that depicted the desired functionality and interaction for the program.This outline aimed to facilitate the visualization of goals and the definition of the desired execution method.

As development progressed, I identified elements that needed to be included and others that required a different order of operation. These changes were gradually incorporated into the initial outline. The outline was conceived using the Lucidchart tool.
