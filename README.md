## Flowchart

In the planning stage, I drafted a basic structure that depicted the desired functionality and interaction for the program.This outline aimed to facilitate the visualization of goals and the definition of the desired execution method.

As development progressed, I identified elements that needed to be included and others that required a different order of operation. These changes were gradually incorporated into the initial outline. The outline was conceived using the Lucidchart tool.

## Features

The "Cosmo Compatibility" begins with an introductory screen, providing an explanation about the nature of the compatibility test. It then presents a user-friendly menu, offering four distinct choices. Users have the opportunity to deepen their understanding of the zodiac signs. Alternatively, they can initiate a 10-question multiple-choice test, aiming to assess, through a percentage bar, how compatible their personality traits are with the descriptions associated with their zodiac sign. Additionally, users can view the compatibility percentages from previous tests. From the main menu, users also have the convenience of concluding the program in a simple and conclusive manner. Through this elaborate interface, users have the freedom to navigate intuitively, customizing the experience to their preferences.

### Introduction

The program utilizes a website to generate stylized text in ASCII art format, presenting the program's name in a way that grabs attention. Just below, a brief explanation is provided to contextualize the purpose of the test. On the same screen, the main menu offers four clear options: explore the zodiac signs, start the test, view compatibility percentages, or exit the program

### Learn more about Zodiac Signs

Given that many people who will take the test may not be familiar with the subject, the first menu option was designed to provide an introduction to the user about what zodiac signs are. This aims to facilitate the user's participation in the test. At this stage of the program, we provide a broader understanding of the meaning of zodiac signs.

### Start the Compatibility Test

When the user clicks on option 2, they will initiate the test. To do this, the program will first collect the month and day of the user's birth in order to determine their zodiac sign.

After collecting the data, the person's zodiac sign will be displayed on the screen, followed by instructions for the test.

Right after, on the same screen, the test starts with the first question. A total of 10 questions will be presented, each with 4 answer choices. Both the questions and answers are randomized. However, out of the 4 options, one will always be the correct answer, namely, the one that best aligns with the personality described for the person's zodiac sign.

#### Progress bar

The progress bar is a visual tool that provides an indication of the test's progress. It is displayed on the screen, just above the question, and shows the progress in terms of questions answered according to the personality description of your zodiac sign. The bar is updated with each user response. If the answer is correct, the bar advances; otherwise, it remains in the same position. The percentage displayed on the bar represents the progress percentage relative to the total number of questions. This feature helps keep the user informed about the test's status and provides an interactive and dynamic experience.

###Â· Result screen

### Update the spreadsheet

At the end of the test, the program proceeds to update the data with the user's responses. This involves several key updates in the spreadsheet:

Sign Row: The row corresponding to the user's zodiac sign is updated:
* Column 2 (Number of Participants): This column is updated to reflect the total number of individuals who have taken the test.
* Column 3 (Number of Correct Answers): The number of correct answers is updated in this column.
* Column 4 (Average Percentage of Correct Answers): This column is updated with the average percentage of correct answers from the tests that have been completed.

### View Compatibility Percentages

The third option in the menu provides users with the opportunity to explore the averages of tests previously taken by other users, based on the updated data from the spreadsheet. This information is visually presented through progress bars, offering a clear view of the compatibility percentages associated with each zodiac sign.

### Exit Program

The final option (4) in the menu is 'Exit Program,' which allows users to conclude the program. Upon selecting this option, the program terminates gracefully, displaying a closing message.

## Features and resources to be added in the future

* Implement synchronized audio feedback in line with the progress of the accuracy bar.

* Adding more questions: Increase the number of question options in the test to make it more comprehensive.

* Implement a feedback feature at the end of the test that displays the answers marked as incorrect by the user, along with providing the response that aligns with the person's zodiac sign
